# Adverse effects of the Sodium Bicarbonate supplementation
## Conditional probabilities

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to investigate if individuals who show (severe or frequent) adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate supplementation have a higher probability of showing more symptoms than those who show trivial adverse effects.

**IN PROGRESS**
